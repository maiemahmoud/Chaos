The matlab is used for feature extraction
Digitized ECG is the data set for the matlab code 
The P,Q, R, S, T waves are the outputs of the matlab code (ECG features)
WEKA package is used to make raw ECG classification and QRS (after get it from the ECG features) classification
The clinical data are added to the ECG and QRS then make classification again (for each case)
The chaos theory is implemented on the QRSs and gives another data set which manipilated by python code for classification using four different algorithms(SVM, Neural Network, Naive Bayes, Dicision Tree
The results of the Dicision Tree is the best when applying chaos theory
