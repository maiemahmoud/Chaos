<ul><li>The matlab is used for feature extraction </li>
<li>Digitized ECG is the data set for the matlab code <li>
<li>The P,Q, R, S, T waves are the outputs of the matlab code (ECG features)</li>
<li>WEKA package is used to make raw ECG classification and QRS (after get it from the ECG features) classification </li>
<li>The clinical data are added to the ECG and QRS then make classification again (for each case) </li>
<li>The chaos theory is implemented on the QRSs and gives another data set which manipilated by python code for classification using four different algorithms(SVM, Neural Network, Naive Bayes, Dicision Tree </li>
<li>The results of the Dicision Tree is the best when applying chaos theory </li></ul>
